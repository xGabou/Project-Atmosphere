/**
 * Selects which separately linked build of the volumetric cloud raymarch a
 * frame binds.
 *
 * <p>T161 splits one monolithic program into two. Both are compiled from the
 * same {@code cloud_atmosphere_volume.fsh}; they differ only in whether the
 * dormant diagnostic selectors are uniforms or compile-time constants.
 *
 * <p>{@link #LEAN_FINAL} is what ordinary rendering uses. Its diagnostic,
 * oracle, trace, legacy and alternate-output paths are statically unreachable,
 * so the driver eliminates them before allocating registers instead of keeping
 * their control flow live inside the march loop. It can only be bound on frames
 * whose uploads would have matched those constants exactly - see
 * {@code VolumetricCloudRenderer.leanFinalEligible()}.
 *
 * <p>{@link #DIAGNOSTIC_MONOLITH} is the unmodified program. Nothing was
 * removed from it: every historical diagnostic campaign still selects it and
 * still drives the same uniforms it always did. It is deliberately never the
 * silent fallback for a FINAL frame, because binding it there would restore the
 * full cost this task exists to remove without changing the image.
 *
 * <p>The experimental evidence for the split is {@code e301494} on
 * {@code experiment/core-cost}: on one PLAY_VIS_NEAR/Ultra fixture the
 * specialized program rendered a pixel-identical image at 2.984x the speed of
 * the monolith. That branch is evidence, not an implementation to merge.
