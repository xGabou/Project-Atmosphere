# Project Atmosphere — Developer Change Log
This file records functionality additions/removals made during development sessions, annotated with the current version from `gradle.properties` at the time of change.

## 0.5.5.7 – Cloud persistence tuning (2025-11-13)
- Clouds now ease toward a humidity-driven target thickness instead of jumping immediately, so growth and dissipation happen over minutes rather than seconds.
- Dissipation speed scales with biome dryness, letting humid areas keep their systems intact while extreme deserts still erode storms after several minutes of exposure.
- Rain intensity ramps in slowly alongside thickness, preventing sudden downpours when a cloud first spawns.

## 0.5.5.7 – Cloud spawn throttling (2025-11-12)
- Added a respawn cooldown to the atmospheric cloud manager so SimpleClouds visuals are not re-created every tick when humidity rapidly crosses the storm threshold.
- Cloud data now persists through dissipation cycles and only attempts a new spawn once the cooldown elapses, preventing runaway "cloud rave" behaviour.

## 0.5.5.7 – Storm factor integration (2025-11-11)
- Removed the legacy storm chance forecast data in favour of live storm factors so gusts, cloud spawners, and SimpleClouds hooks follow the new cyclone/sunlight-driven core.
- Wind gust multipliers now scale smoothly with the measured storm factor instead of toggling at a fixed threshold.

## 0.5.5.7 – Biome-driven cloud evolution (2025-11-10)
- SimpleClouds regions now sample the biome beneath them to grow in cool, humid climates and dissipate over hot or arid zones.
- Cloud radius changes gradually each tick with matching lifetime adjustments so long-lived storm systems persist over wet areas and burn out faster in deserts.
- Cloud radius multipliers persist through sync/serialization and stay clamped, preventing abrupt pop-in while still allowing clouds to shrink back when conditions stabilise.

## 0.5.5.7 – Biome-aware sunlight tuning (2025-11-09)
- Sunlight intensity now scales with each biome’s seasonal temperature ranges, letting hotter climates receive stronger midday heating.
- Region states keep hourly daily curves sourced from the live controllers so commands and clients can still display day profiles.
- Build automation skips CurseForge uploads and Discord notifications automatically when their environment tokens are absent.

## 0.5.5.7 – Dynamic atmosphere simulation (2025-11-08)
- Replaced daily forecast regeneration with a live atmospheric state registry that evolves continuously.
- Added sunlight, cyclone, cloud, rain, and wind controllers so temperature, humidity, and pressure react to in-game forces.
- Updated commands and client helpers to report the new dynamic values and removed the legacy daily forecast generator.

## 0.5.5.7 – Aurora & rainbow integration (2025-11-07)
- Added optional compatibility hooks for the Auroras and Rainbows mods.
  - Aurora brightness now scales with Serene Seasons data and is boosted in freezing biomes.
  - Rainbows rely on the Project Atmosphere / Serene Seasons Plus rain helper so they only trigger after custom storms clear.
- Introduced guarded client mixins plus a rain-state tracker so these integrations activate only when the companion mods are installed.
- Refined aurora and rainbow compatibility syncing.
  - Aurora brightness now queries Project Atmosphere’s live temperature data (or active temperature mods) instead of static biome values.
  - Rainbows receive server-synchronised rainfall intensity from SimpleClouds spawns/despawns, allowing accurate rain stop triggers across dimensions and for joining players.

## 0.5.5.4 – Non-vanilla biome resolution (2025-10-24)
- BiomeTempConfig now resolves un-namespaced biome keys by scanning the biome registry.
  - Non-vanilla biomes defined without a namespace (e.g., `bog`) resolve to their mod ids when uniquely found (e.g., `biomesoplenty:bog`).
  - If multiple mods provide the same path, mappings apply to all matches and an info log is emitted.
  - If no match is found, falls back to `minecraft:<path>` and logs a warning.
  - Applies to `putAllSeasons`, `putConstSeasons`, and `mirrorBiome`.

## 0.5.5.2 — Imperial Units Mode (2025-10-19)
- Added config option `display.imperialUnits` to toggle display units.
- Overlay and commands now respect units:
  - Temperature shows as °F when enabled (°C otherwise).
  - Wind speed shows as mph when enabled (m/s otherwise).
  - Pressure shows as inHg when enabled (hPa otherwise).
- In-game config screen adds an “Imperial Units” toggle under Display.
- Regeneration safety: clearing/regenerating forecasts now pauses dependent ticks (wind physics, tornado/hurricane/snowstorm managers), and defers scheduled tornado checks until regeneration completes.

## 0.5.4.4 — Added weatherdebug cloud command (2025-10-17)
- Added command: `/weatherdebug cloud <id>`
  - Spawns the specified SimpleClouds cloud at the player’s position/biome.
  - Requires permission level 2.
  - Applies current wind sample; fails gracefully if SimpleClouds is not initialized.
